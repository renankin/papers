# Title
Measurement-model comparison of biomass burning emissions over West Africa

# Abstract
Always write this last, because it's the most difficult to write. Summarise the best bits so people want to read on.

# Introduction
JOe Bloggs et al (2004) already did some measurements, but haven't completed science yet, hence our new measurements giving new insight and pushing the boundaries of science. This is another citation from Einstein.

Haywood et al (1999) were the pioneers of this type of measurement.

# Simulations
John has an awesome box model that he's using to simulate particle growth downwind of the fires.

# Methodology
We used an AMS to measure particle mass and chemical composition.
The AMS is described in Allen et al 2004.

# Results
The simulation was able to reproduce the observed particle growth, so it's due to coagulation rather than condensation.

# Conclusion
We found out some stuff, but give us more money to find out more stuff.

# Figures
This is where the figures go in a draft.
