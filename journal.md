# Title
Measurement-model comparison of biomass burning emissions over West Africa

# Introduction
JOe Bloggs et al (2004) already did some measurements, but haven't completed science yet, hence our new measurements giving new insight and pushing the boundaries of science. This is another citation from Einstein.

Haywood et al (1999) were the pioneers of this type of measurement.

# Simulations
John has an awesome box model that he's using to simulate particle growth downwind of the fires.
